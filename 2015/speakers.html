		<p><b>Klaus Schömann</b><br/><br/>
		Professor Dr. Klaus Schömann has been a professor at Jacobs University Bremen since 2004. 
		Now an adjunct professor he has returned to a research position at the Deutsches Institut 
		Erwachsenenbildung in Bonn where he is involved in such projects as research targeting 
		countries to improve adult literacy rates, and more. In his own words describing his 
		research interests and career’s focus, you’ll get a glimpse of what he will share:<br/>
		<i>“Aging societies, life courses and lifelong learning are the main topics of my research. 
		The life course perspective consists in analysing major transitions throughout the life 
		course, such as the transition from school to work, job mobility and retirement transitions.”</i> </p>

		<p><b>Ralf Fücks</b><br/><br/>
 		Ralf Fücks has been a member of the executive board of the Heinrich Böll Foundation since 1996. 
 		Together with his colleagues, he rebuilt the foundation completely, moving its headquarters to
 		 Berlin. In November 2011, he was re-elected for a fourth term. The primary focus of his work 
 		 is on sustainable development, reshaping the welfare state, migration, the future of European 
 		 integration, and on foreign policy. He is responsible for the divisions of domestic political 
 		 education, Europe and North America, German-Israeli-Relations as well as for the foundation’s 
 		 scholarship program.</p>

	<p><b>Paul O’Maille <br/><i>Ph.D., Project Leader, Department of Metabolic Biology, John Innes Centre, 
	Food and Health Programme, Institute of Food Research, Norwich UK</i></b><br/><br/>
 
	Dr. Paul O’Maille received a B.S. in Chemistry from John Carroll University, University Hts, OH in 1995, 
	then earned his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH in 2001. Paul then went
	 on for postdoctoral training at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA where he was 
	 honored as a NIH Postdoctoral Fellow in 2003 and continued on as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
	 Research Associate in 2005. Currently, Paul is a Project Leader at John Innes Center (JIC) where his 
	 group investigates the origins of chemical diversity in specialized metabolism of plants with a focus 
	 on cyclization reactions catalyzed by terpene synthases. Along with his role at JIC, he serves as a 
	 Project Leader at the Institute of Food Research (IFR), where his group investigates the bioactivity 
	 (drug action) of terpenes—the consequences of cyclic terpene diversity on human health.</p>

	<p><b>Britta and Amit Gupta<br/><i>Architects, Founders of Studio Symbiosis</i></b><br/><br/>
	Britta and Amit Gupta are the co-founders of Studio Symbiosis Architects. They are known for their 
	dynamic and pioneering works with a focus on creating spaces that exist in equilibrium with their 
	surroundings. The project portfolio displays a wide repertoire of design exploration ranging from Master
	 plans, Hospitality, Mixed use development, Offices, Housing and Villas. Amit Gupta and Britta Knobel Gupta 
	 have done their masters in Architecture and Urbanism from the prestigious Architectural Association London,
	  and have also worked for Zaha Hadid Architects for a period of 5 years, where they were involved in a 
	  number of award winning projects at the office. According to the firm, "In nature through the process 
	  of self-organization intrinsic patterns emerge. It is a system of inclusion of complexity as opposed to 
	  the system of exclusion. Instead of discarding information and creating a reduced whole, we like to 
	  integrate the complexity in the design, following the principle of inclusion, thereby resulting in an 
	  amalgamated design with a high level of sophistication."</p>

	<p><b>Betty Mohler<br/><i>PhD, Research Group Leader, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</i></b><br/><br/>
	Dr. Mohler’s research focuses on using and improving virtual reality technology by scientifically exploring 
	human perception and action. Her research, as she puts it, is done by “animating and manipulating virtual 
	human characters (avatars). Using avatars we can systematically explore the influence of visual information 
	about the body (size, shape, identity) on human behavior, such as space perception, object interaction, 
	communication and decision making.”Also, based on the results obtained from her experiments, she aims to 
	improve Virtual Reality technology and software.

	Study of biology and chemistry in Bonn, postdoctoral lecture qualification at the Universität Würzburg, 
	several years of research activity at Bionord, Bremerhaven.
 	<br/>Some main areas of focus are natural materials and organisms from marine resources, 
 	new applications for marine materials (micro-capsules, micro-gels), as well as processes 
 	and methods with surfaces (micro-enzyme reactors, biofilms). Further projects deal with the 
 	development of biological components for bioanalytical systems (immune sensors, gen sensors).
